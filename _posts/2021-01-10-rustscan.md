Learn how to use RustScan.

## Installing RustScan
- Go to [here](https://github.com/RustScan/RustScan/releases) (for Debian / Kali Linux).
- Download the `.deb` file.
- Go to the Downloads folder / where you put the file is.
    ```bash
    $ cd ~/Downloads
```
- Run `dpkg -i` on the file.
    ```bash
    $ sudo dpkg -i rustscan_2.0.1_amd64.deb
    ```
- Test the `rustscan` command in terminal.
    ```bash
    $ rustscan              
    .----. .-. .-. .----..---.  .----. .---.   .--.  .-. .-.
    | {}  }| { } |{ {__ {_   _}{ {__  /  ___} / {} \ |  `| |
    | .-. \| {_} |.-._} } | |  .-._} }\     }/  /\  \| |\  |

    [~] The config file is expected to be at "/home/kali/.rustscan.toml"
    [!] No IPs could be resolved, aborting scan.
    ```
- Success!

## Features
RustScan is extensible by the RustScan Scripting Engine. This allows you to write a script which runs after the scan has completed, taking inputs of open ports and their respective IPs. RSE supports:
- Python
- Shell
- Perl
- Any program which is a binary and in `$PATH`

RustScan's scripting engine can be altered using the `--scripts` argument. 3 possible arguments:
- None (don't run any scripts)
- Custom (run all scripts in the scripts folder)
    - To execute a custom script, we need a `rustscan_scripts.toml` file located at `$HOME/.rustscan_scripts.toml`
- Default (runs Nmap script, or whatever script is in the config file. Default does not need to be enabled, it is on by default.)

#### What is the scripting file config called?
> rustscan_scripts.toml

#### Can you run other binaries with RustScan? (T)rue / (F)alse.
> True, we can run with other programs, such Nmap, GoBuster, etc.

#### Does RutScan support scripts in Javascript? (T)rue / (F)alse.
> Only supports:<br>Python, Shell, Perl, or any program which is a binary and in $PATH.

## Scanning Time!
- Basic format:
    ```bash
    rustscan -r ports -a  <Target-ip> -- <nmap cmds>
    ```
- Multiple IP Scanning
    ```bash
    rustscan -a 127.0.0.1,0.0.0.0
    ```
- Host Scanning
    ```bash
    âžœ rustscan -a www.google.com, 127.0.0.1
    Open 216.58.210.36:1
    Open 216.58.210.36:80
    Open 216.58.210.36:443
    Open 127.0.0.1:53
    Open 127.0.0.1:631
    ```
- CIDR support
    ```bash
    rustscan -a 192.168.0.0/30
    ```
- Hosts file as input
    ```bash
    rustscan -a 'hosts.txt'
    ```
- Custom Port Scanning
    ```bash
    # individual port
    rustscan -a 127.0.0.1 -p 53

    # multiple ports
    rustscan -a 127.0.0.1 -p 53,80,121,65535

    # range of ports
    rustscan -a 127.0.0.1 --range 1-1000 

    # random port ordering 
    rustscan -a 127.0.0.1 --range 1-1000 --scan-order "Random"
    ```
- Adjusting the Nmap args
    ```bash
    rustscan -a 127.0.0.1 -- -A -sC

    # to run:
    # nmap -Pn -vvv -p $PORTS -A -sC 127.0.0.1
    ```

#### Try running the scan for all ports.
```bash
$ rustscan -a 10.10.159.68 --range 1-65535                                                               1 â¨¯
