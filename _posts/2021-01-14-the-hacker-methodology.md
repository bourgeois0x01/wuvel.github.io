Introduction to the Hacker Methodology

## Methodology Outline 
The Process that pentesters follow is summarized in the following steps:
1. Reconnaissance
1. Enumeration/Scanning
1. Gaining Access
1. Privilege Escalation
1. Covering Tracks
1. Reporting

## Reconnaissance Overview
- Reconnaissance is all about **collecting information** about your target. Reconnaissance usually involves **no interaction** with the target(s) or system(s). 
- Reconnaissance is a pretty simple concept, think about what tools we can use on the internet to gather information about people.
- Reconnaissance usually involves using publicly available tools like Google to conduct research about your target.
- There are some specialized tools that we can utilize but for this introduction it is good to know the following tools. 
    - Google (specifically Google Dorking)
    - Wikipedia
    - PeopleFinder.com
    - who.is
    - sublist3r
    - hunter.io
    - builtwith.com
    - wappalyzer

#### Who is the CEO of SpaceX?
> Elon Musk

#### Do some research into the tool: sublist3r, what does it list?
> Subdomain enumeration

#### What is it called when you use Google to look for specific vulnerabilities or to research a specific topic of interest?
> Google dorking
