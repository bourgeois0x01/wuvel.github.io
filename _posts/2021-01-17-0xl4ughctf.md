## Web
### Cake Shop
When we access the website, we got the cake purchase screen with our balance and if we got our cookie as `UserInfo`.

<a href="/assets/images/ctf/0xl4ugh/web1/1.png"><img src="/assets/images/ctf/0xl4ugh/web1/1.png"></a>

Let's decode the cookie value.

<a href="/assets/images/ctf/0xl4ugh/web1/2.png"><img src="/assets/images/ctf/0xl4ugh/web1/2.png"></a>

It's base32 and the value is our money. So, let's change our money to `9999999999999` so we can buy the flag cake.

<a href="/assets/images/ctf/0xl4ugh/web1/4.png"><img src="/assets/images/ctf/0xl4ugh/web1/4.png"></a>

Change our cookie with our own value, buy the flag cookie, and we got the flag!

<a href="/assets/images/ctf/0xl4ugh/web1/5.png"><img src="/assets/images/ctf/0xl4ugh/web1/5.png"></a>

### EasyLogin
Access the website, we got a login panel.

<a href="/assets/images/ctf/0xl4ugh/web2/1.png"><img src="/assets/images/ctf/0xl4ugh/web2/1.png"></a>

Let's view the source code first, maybe there is something useful.

<a href="/assets/images/ctf/0xl4ugh/web2/2.png"><img src="/assets/images/ctf/0xl4ugh/web2/2.png"></a>

We got login credential, let's login then.

<a href="/assets/images/ctf/0xl4ugh/web2/3.png"><img src="/assets/images/ctf/0xl4ugh/web2/3.png"></a>

We got a form, let's input anything and see the result.

<a href="/assets/images/ctf/0xl4ugh/web2/4.png"><img src="/assets/images/ctf/0xl4ugh/web2/4.png"></a>

Nothing strange, let's see the source code.

<a href="/assets/images/ctf/0xl4ugh/web2/5.png"><img src="/assets/images/ctf/0xl4ugh/web2/5.png"></a>

We got a hint, `Inject An HTML Tag and Give Him The ID flaghunt`. Let's do it. There is some filtering though, so we need the right payload. For example i used `h1` tag and i got this.

<a href="/assets/images/ctf/0xl4ugh/web2/h1blocked.png"><img src="/assets/images/ctf/0xl4ugh/web2/h1blocked.png"></a>

After messing around, i used this payload to bypass some filter:

```html
<a id='flagHunt'>abc</a>
```

Inject the payload and we got this.

<a href="/assets/images/ctf/0xl4ugh/web2/6.png"><img src="/assets/images/ctf/0xl4ugh/web2/6.png"></a>

Let's see our console through the Developer Tools and we got the flag.

<a href="/assets/images/ctf/0xl4ugh/web2/7.png"><img src="/assets/images/ctf/0xl4ugh/web2/7.png"></a>

### Sad_Agent
Access the website and we got a button and joker there.

<a href="/assets/images/ctf/0xl4ugh/web3/1.png"><img src="/assets/images/ctf/0xl4ugh/web3/1.png"></a>

Let's click the button.

<a href="/assets/images/ctf/0xl4ugh/web3/2.png"><img src="/assets/images/ctf/0xl4ugh/web3/2.png"></a>

It reflect back my User Agent, let's intercept the request.

<a href="/assets/images/ctf/0xl4ugh/web3/3.png"><img src="/assets/images/ctf/0xl4ugh/web3/3.png"></a>

It's accept our `url` POST variable and run it. Hmm, i think we can manipulate the value and run arbitrary command. Dont forget to encode it as base64.

<a href="/assets/images/ctf/0xl4ugh/web3/4.png"><img src="/assets/images/ctf/0xl4ugh/web3/4.png"></a>

Let's use it at `url` POST variable and run it.

<a href="/assets/images/ctf/0xl4ugh/web3/5.png"><img src="/assets/images/ctf/0xl4ugh/web3/5.png"></a>

Let's `cat` all files in there and we got the flag.

<a href="/assets/images/ctf/0xl4ugh/web3/6.png"><img src="/assets/images/ctf/0xl4ugh/web3/6.png"></a>

### Embedding
Let's acces the website. A simple form. Let's try input `ls`.

<a href="/assets/images/ctf/0xl4ugh/web4/3.png"><img src="/assets/images/ctf/0xl4ugh/web4/3.png"></a>

Reflect back my input. Let's try `"` character.

<a href="/assets/images/ctf/0xl4ugh/web4/4.png"><img src="/assets/images/ctf/0xl4ugh/web4/4.png"></a>

Hmm, some filtering there. I use `file_get_contents` to get the `index.php` file first.

<a href="/assets/images/ctf/0xl4ugh/web4/1.png"><img src="/assets/images/ctf/0xl4ugh/web4/1.png"></a>

We can see some filter rules there, i finally got the bypass with `base64decode`, so we can input anything with base64 encoding. Let's cat our flag at `fl@g.php` file.

<a href="/assets/images/ctf/0xl4ugh/web4/2.png"><img src="/assets/images/ctf/0xl4ugh/web4/2.png"></a>


## Reverse Engineering
### Home
Let's check the file first.

<a href="/assets/images/ctf/0xl4ugh/reverse1/1.png"><img src="/assets/images/ctf/0xl4ugh/reverse1/1.png"></a>

32-bit LSB. Let's use IDA 32-bit to solve this problem.

<a href="/assets/images/ctf/0xl4ugh/reverse1/2.png"><img src="/assets/images/ctf/0xl4ugh/reverse1/2.png"></a>

So, we just need to decompile the `win` function and we got the flag.

### WannaCry
Let's check the file first.

<a href="/assets/images/ctf/0xl4ugh/reverse2/1.png"><img src="/assets/images/ctf/0xl4ugh/reverse2/1.png"></a>

32-bit LSB. Let's use IDA 32-bit to solve this problem.

<a href="/assets/images/ctf/0xl4ugh/reverse2/2.png"><img src="/assets/images/ctf/0xl4ugh/reverse2/2.png"></a>

So, we just need to decompile the `vuln` function, read the hex and we got the flag.

## Crypto
### Cyclops
Download the attachment file and see what's inside.

<a href="/assets/images/ctf/0xl4ugh/B.png"><img src="/assets/images/ctf/0xl4ugh/B.png"></a>

It's a Braille. Let's decode it. It's `0xL4ugh{I_Th1nk_Br1ll3_W45_$m4rt}`.

### Me & You
Download the attachment file and see what's inside.

```
{ ^),!&),!!$,^$,!^%,!$&,!%),!&#,!!#,^#,!&!,!$@,^),!$!,!^@,!$$,!#&,^!,!^#,!#&,!!),^#,!!$,!@),!)^,!@%,^!,^!,!&% }
```

It's the character on the keyboard with SHIFT on. Let's decode it.

```
60 170 114 64 165 147 150 173 113 63 171 142 60 141 162 144 137 61 163 137 110 63 114 120 106 125 61 61 175
```

Hemm, it's not ASCII but it's Octal! Let's decode it again. The flag is `0xL4ugh{K3yb0ard_1s_H3LPFU11}`.


## Forensics
### Baby Shark
Download the attachment file and open it with wireshark. After inspecting it a while, i found a POST request to `login.php` and it contains the password's value.

<a href="/assets/images/ctf/0xl4ugh/foren/1.png"><img src="/assets/images/ctf/0xl4ugh/foren/1.png"></a>

Let's decode it, it's base58 encoding.

<a href="/assets/images/ctf/0xl4ugh/foren/2.png"><img src="/assets/images/ctf/0xl4ugh/foren/2.png"></a>


## Osint
### Message From Boss
>My Boss Told Me That He will send me a message by an account  that follow this twitter user
(0xL4ugh) but i canâ€™t Find It 
can you give it to me

Let's go to 0xl4ugh twitter and go to the follower section and find user that suspicious.

<a href="/assets/images/ctf/0xl4ugh/osint/1.png"><img src="/assets/images/ctf/0xl4ugh/osint/1.png"></a>

We found `CanuSeeMe` user, let's go to his profile.

<a href="/assets/images/ctf/0xl4ugh/osint/2.png"><img src="/assets/images/ctf/0xl4ugh/osint/2.png"></a>

A `pastebin` link, let's visit the link.

<a href="/assets/images/ctf/0xl4ugh/osint/3.png"><img src="/assets/images/ctf/0xl4ugh/osint/3.png"></a>

We need password to open it. Let's use [wayback machine](https://archive.org/web/) to see the past saved archive and we got the flag.

<a href="/assets/images/ctf/0xl4ugh/osint/4.png"><img src="/assets/images/ctf/0xl4ugh/osint/4.png"></a>


## Misc
### Sanity check
Join the discord and visit the `rules` channel and go to the channel description to get flag.

<a href="/assets/images/ctf/0xl4ugh/misc/1.png"><img src="/assets/images/ctf/0xl4ugh/misc/1.png"></a>

### Noisy
Download the attachment file and see what's inside.

<a href="/assets/images/ctf/0xl4ugh/misc/22.png"><img src="/assets/images/ctf/0xl4ugh/misc/22.png"></a>

A `.wav` file, i tried several technique and found one with spectal analysis.

<a href="/assets/images/ctf/0xl4ugh/misc/2.png"><img src="/assets/images/ctf/0xl4ugh/misc/2.png"></a>

### Gesture
Download the file and we got `gesture.key`. It's a `android lock` key. Let's use [gesture crack](https://github.com/KieronCraggs/GestureCrack) to solve this.

<a href="/assets/images/ctf/0xl4ugh/misc/3.png"><img src="/assets/images/ctf/0xl4ugh/misc/3.png"></a>

### 1990
Download the file and we got `.wav` file. It seems a old telephone keyboard sound. I found [this](https://github.com/ribt/dtmf-decoder) tool to decode the sound.

<a href="/assets/images/ctf/0xl4ugh/misc/4.png"><img src="/assets/images/ctf/0xl4ugh/misc/4.png"></a>

Let's decode it manually xD and we got the flag.

<a href="/assets/images/ctf/0xl4ugh/misc/5.png"><img src="/assets/images/ctf/0xl4ugh/misc/5.png"></a>
