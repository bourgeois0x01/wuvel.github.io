This room teaches the basics of x86-64 assembly language

## Introduction
Computers execute machine code, which is encoded as bytes, to carry out tasks on a computer. Since different computers have different processors, the machine code executed on these computers is specific to the processor. In this case, we’ll be looking at the Intel x86-64 instruction set architecture which is most commonly found today. Machine code is usually represented by a more readable form of the code called assembly code. This machine is code is usually produced by a compiler, which takes the source code of a file, and after going through some intermediate stages, produces machine code that can be executed by a computer. Without going into too much detail, Intel first started out by building 16-bit instruction set, followed by 32 bit, after which they finally created 64 bit. All these instruction sets have been created for backward compatibility, so code compiled for 32 bit architecture will run on 64 bit machines. As mentioned earlier, before an executable file is produced, the source code is first compiled into assembly(.s files), after which the assembler converts it into an object program(.o files), and operations with a linker finally make it an executable. 

SSH to the machine and follow the intructions.
- Execute the program.

    ```bash
    tryhackme@ip-10-10-190-8:~$ cd introduction/
    tryhackme@ip-10-10-190-8:~/introduction$ ./intro 
    value for a is 1 and b is 2
    value of a is 2 and b is 1
    ```

    From the execution, it can be seen that the program is creating two variables and switching their values. Time to see what it’s actually doing under the hood!

- Run radare.

    ```bash
    tryhackme@ip-10-10-190-8:~/introduction$ r2 -d intro
    Process with PID 1392 started...
    = attach 1392 1392
    bin.baddr 0x55b4249ea000
    Using 0x55b4249ea000
    asm.bits 64
    -- .-. .- -.. .- .-. . ..---
    [0x7fbd53999090]>
    ```

    This will open the binary in debugging mode

- Once the binary is open, one of the first things to do is ask r2 to analyze the program, and this can be done by typing in:

    ```bash
    [0x7fbd53999090]> aa
    [x] Analyze all flags starting with sym. and entry0 (aa)
    ```

    Which is the most common analysis command. It analyses all symbols and entry points in the executable.

- (Optional) Set the disassembly syntax to AT&T.

    ```bash
    [0x7fbd53999090]> e asm.syntax=att
    ```

- The analysis in this case involves extracting function names, flow control information and much more! r2 instructions are usually based on a single character, so it is easy to get more information about the commands. For general help, run:

    ```bash
    [0x7f00522a3090]> ?
    Usage: [.][times][cmd][~grep][@[@iter]addr!size][|>pipe] ; ...   
    Append '?' to any char command to get detailed help

    | ?>?                     output redirection
    ```

- For more specific information, for example, about analysis, run

    ```bash
    [0x7f00522a3090]> a?
    Usage: a  [abdefFghoprxstc] [...]
    | aa[?]              analyze all (fcns + bbs) (aa0 to avoid sub renaming)

    | av[?] [.]          show vtables
    | ax[?]              manage refs/xrefs (see also afx?)
    ```

- Once the analysis is complete, you would want to know where to start analysing from - most programs have an entry point defined as main. To find a list of the functions run:

    ```bash
    [0x7f00522a3090]> afl
    0x5561ffdd1560    1 42           entry0
    0x5561fffd1fe0    1 4124         reloc.__libc_start_main
    0x5561ffdd1590    4 50   -> 40   sym.deregister_tm_clones
    0x5561ffdd15d0    4 66   -> 57   sym.register_tm_clones
    0x5561ffdd1620    5 58   -> 51   entry.fini0
    0x5561ffdd1550    1 6            sym..plt.got
    0x5561ffdd1660    1 10           entry.init0
    0x5561ffdd1730    1 2            sym.__libc_csu_fini
    0x5561ffdd1734    1 9            sym._fini
    0x5561ffdd16c0    4 101          sym.__libc_csu_init
    0x5561ffdd166a    1 78           main
    0x5561ffdd1540    1 6            sym.imp.__printf_chk
    0x5561ffdd1510    3 23           sym._init
    0x5561ffdd1000    3 97   -> 123  map.home_tryhackme_introduction_intro.r_x
    ```

- As seen here, there actually is a function at main. Let’s examine the assembly code at main by running the command:

    ```bash
    [0x7f00522a3090]> pdf @main
    / (fcn) main 78
    |   int main (int argc, char **argv, char **envp);
    |           ; DATA XREF from entry0 (0x5561ffdd157d)
    |           0x5561ffdd166a      4883ec08       subq $8, %rsp
    |           0x5561ffdd166e      b902000000     movl $2, %ecx
    |           0x5561ffdd1673      ba01000000     movl $1, %edx
    |           0x5561ffdd1678      488d35c90000.  leaq str.value_for_a_is__d_and_b_is__d, %rsi ; 0x5561ffdd1748 ; "value for a is %d and b is %d\n"
    |           0x5561ffdd167f      bf01000000     movl $1, %edi
    |           0x5561ffdd1684      b800000000     movl $0, %eax
    |           0x5561ffdd1689      e8b2feffff     callq sym.imp.__printf_chk
    |           0x5561ffdd168e      b901000000     movl $1, %ecx
    |           0x5561ffdd1693      ba02000000     movl $2, %edx
    |           0x5561ffdd1698      488d35c90000.  leaq str.value_of_a_is__d_and_b_is__d, %rsi ; 0x5561ffdd1768 ; "value of a is %d and b is %d\n"
    |           0x5561ffdd169f      bf01000000     movl $1, %edi
    |           0x5561ffdd16a4      b800000000     movl $0, %eax
    |           0x5561ffdd16a9      e892feffff     callq sym.imp.__printf_chk
    |           0x5561ffdd16ae      b800000000     movl $0, %eax
    |           0x5561ffdd16b3      4883c408       addq $8, %rsp
    \           0x5561ffdd16b7      c3             retq
    ```

    Where pdf means print disassembly function. As we can see from above, the values on the complete left column are memory addresses of the instructions, and these are usually stored in a structure called the stack(which we will talk about later). The middle column contains the instructions encoded in bytes(what is usually the machine code), and the last column actually contains the human readable instructions. 

The core of assembly language involves using registers to do the following:
- Transfer data between memory and register, and vice versa
- Perform arithmetic operations on registers and data
- Transfer control to other parts of the program

Since the architecture is x86-64, the registers are 64 bit and Intel has a list of 16 registers:

<a href="/assets/images/tryhackme/intro-x86-64/1.png"><img src="/assets/images/tryhackme/intro-x86-64/1.png"></a>

Even though the registers are 64 bit, meaning they can hold up to 64 bits of data, other parts of the registers can also be referenced. Registers can also be referenced as 32 bit values, 16 bit and 8 bit(higher 4 bit and lower 4 bit). 

The first 6 registers are known as general purpose registers. The `%rsp` is the stack pointer and it points to the top of the stack which contains the most recent memory address. The stack is a data structure that manages memory for programs. `%rbp` is a frame pointer and points to the frame of the function currently being executed - every function is executed in a new frame. To move data using registers, the following instruction is used:

```bash
movq source, destination
```

This involves:
- Transferring constants(which are prefixed using the `$` operator) e.g. movq `$3` rax would move the constant 3 to the register
- Transferring values from a register e.g. movq `%rax` `%rbx` which involves moving value from rax to rbx
- Transferring values from memory which is shown by putting registers inside brackets e.g. movq `%rax` (`%rbx`) which means move value stored in `%rax` to memory location represented by `%rbx`.

The last letter of the mov instruction represents the size of the data:

| Intel Data Type | Suffix | Size (bytes) | 
| --------------- | ------ | ------------ |
| Byte | b | 1 | 
| Word | W | 2 |
| Double Word | l | 4 |
| Quad Word | q | 8 | 
| Single Precision | s | 4 | 
| Double Precision | l | 8 |

When dealing with memory manipulation using registers, there are other cases to be considered:
- (Rb, Ri) = MemoryLocation[Rb + Ri]
- D(Rb, Ri) = MemoryLocation[Rb + Ri + D]
- (Rb, Ri, S) = MemoryLocation(Rb + S * Ri]
- D(Rb, Ri, S) = MemoryLocation[Rb + S * Ri + D]  

Some other important instructions are:
- `leaq source, destination`: this instruction sets destination to the address denoted by the expression in source
- `addq source, destination`: destination = destination + source
- `subq source, destination`: destination = destination - source
- `imulq source, destination`: destination = destination * source
- `salq source, destination`: destination = destination << source where << is the left bit shifting operator
- `sarq source, destination`: destination = destination >> source where >> is the right bit shifting operator
- `xorq source, destination`: destination = destination XOR source
- `andq source, destination`: destination = destination AND source
- `orq source, destination`: destination = destination OR source

## If Statements
The general format of an if statement is:

```java
if(condition){
  do-stuff-here
}else if(condition) //this is an optional condition {
  do-stuff-here
}else {
  do-stuff-here
}
```

If statements use 3 important instructions in assembly:
- `cmpq source2, source1`: it is like computing a-b without setting destination
- `testq source2, source1`: it is like computing a&b without setting destination

Jump instructions are used to transfer control to different instructions, and there are different types of jumps:

| Jump Type | Description | 
| --------- | ----------- |
| jmp | Unconditional | 
| je | Equal / Zero | 
| jne | Not Equal / Not Zero | 
| js | Negative |
| jns | Non-Negative |
| jg | Greater |
| jge | Greater or Equal | 
| jl | Less | 
| jle | Less or Equal | 
| ja | Above (unsigned) | 
| jb | Below (unsigned) |

The last 2 values of the table refer to unsigned integers. Unsigned integers cannot be negative while signed integers represent both positive and negative values. SInce the computer needs to differentiate between them, it uses different methods to interpret these values. For signed integers, it uses something called the two’s complement representation and for unsigned integers it uses normal binary calculations. 

## If Statements Continued
Follow the instructions:
- Go to the if-statement folder and Start r2 with `r2 -d if1`:

    ```bash
    tryhackme@ip-10-10-190-8:~/introduction$ cd ../if-statement/
    tryhackme@ip-10-10-190-8:~/if-statement$ r2 -d if1
    Process with PID 1488 started...
    = attach 1488 1488

    Using 0x557ce01e0000
    asm.bits 64
    -- Microloft Visual Radare.NET 2008. Now OOXML Powered!
    ```

- And run the following commands:

    ```bash
    [0x7f4edab67090]> aaa
    [x] Analyze all flags starting with sym. and entry0 (aa)
    [Warning: Invalid range. Use different search.in=? or anal.in=dbg.maps.x

    \           0x557ce01e0624      c3             retq
    ```

- We’ll then start by setting a break point on the `jge` and the `jmp` instruction by using the command:

    ```bash
    [0x7f4edab67090]> db 0x557ce01e0612
    [0x7f4edab67090]> db 0x557ce01e0618
    ```

    `db 0x7f4edab67090` (which is the hex address of the `jge` instruction) 
    `db 0x7f4edab67090` (which is the hex address of the `jmp` instruction)

- We've added breakpoints to stop the execution of the program at those points so we can see the state of the program. Here is the result:

    ```bash
    [0x7f4edab67090]> pdf @main
    / (fcn) main 43
    |   int main (int argc, char **argv, char **envp);

    |           ; var int32_t var_4h @ rbp-0x4

- We now run `dc` to start execution of the program and the program will start execution and stop at the break point. Let’s examine what has happened before hitting the breakpoint:
    - The first 2 lines are about pushing the frame pointer onto the stack and saving it (this is about how functions are called, and will be examined later)
    - The next 3 lines are about assigning values 3 and 4 to the local arguments/variables `var_8h` and `var_4h`. It then stores the value in `var_8h` in the %eax register. 
    - The `cmpl` instruction compares the value of eax with that of the `var_8h` argument

- To view the value of the registers, type in: `dr`.

    ```bash
    [0x557ce01e0612]> dr
    rax = 0x00000003
    rbx = 0x00000000
    rcx = 0x557ce01e0630
    rdx = 0x7ffeac286338
    r8 = 0x7f4edab61d80
    r9 = 0x7f4edab61d80
    r10 = 0x00000000
    r11 = 0x00000000
    r12 = 0x557ce01e04f0
    r13 = 0x7ffeac286320
    r14 = 0x00000000
    r15 = 0x00000000
    rsi = 0x7ffeac286328
    rdi = 0x00000001
    rsp = 0x7ffeac286240
    rbp = 0x7ffeac286240
    rip = 0x557ce01e0612
    rflags = 0x00000297
    orax = 0xffffffffffffffff
    ```

    We can see that the value of `rax`, which is the 64 bit version of `eax` contains 3. We saw that the `jge` instruction is jumping based on whether value of `eax` is greater than `var_4h`. To see what’s in `var_4h`, we can see that at top of the main function, it tells us the position of `var_4h`. 
    
- Run the command: `px @rbp-0x4`.

    <a href="/assets/images/tryhackme/intro-x86-64/4.png"><img src="/assets/images/tryhackme/intro-x86-64/4.png"></a>

    And that shows the value of 4 at 0 offset.

- We know that `eax` contains 3, and 3 is not greater than 4, so the jump will not execute. Instead it will move to the next instruction. To check this, run the `ds` command which seeks/moves onto the next instruction.

    <a href="/assets/images/tryhackme/intro-x86-64/2.png"><img src="/assets/images/tryhackme/intro-x86-64/2.png"></a>

- The rip (which is the current instruction pointer) shows that it moves onto the next instruction - which shows we are correct. The current instruction then adds 5 to `var_8h` which is a local argument. To see that this actually happens, first check the value of `var_8h`, run ds and check the value again. This will show it increments by 5.

    <a href="/assets/images/tryhackme/intro-x86-64/3.png"><img src="/assets/images/tryhackme/intro-x86-64/3.png"></a>

    Note that because we are checking the exact address, we only need to check to 0 offset. The value stored in memory is stored as hex. 

- The next instruction is an unconditional jump and it just jumps to clearing the `eax` register. The `popq` instruction involves popping a value of the stack and reading it, and the return instruction sets this popped value to the current instruction pointer. In this case, it shows the execution of the program has been completed. To understand better about how an if statement work, you can check the corresponding C file in the same folder:

    ```c
    #include <stdio.h>
    int main(void){  
        int a = 3;  
        int b = 4;  
        if(a < b){    
            a += 5;  
        } else{    
            b += 3;  
        }  
        return 0;
    }
    ```

#### Answer for if2 binary
- Open the binary with radare2 and analyze the program and print the list of function inside.

    <a href="/assets/images/tryhackme/intro-x86-64/5.png"><img src="/assets/images/tryhackme/intro-x86-64/5.png"></a>

- Disassemble the main function.

    <a href="/assets/images/tryhackme/intro-x86-64/6.png"><img src="/assets/images/tryhackme/intro-x86-64/6.png"></a>

- Set the breakpoint before the `popq` and `ret` instructions.

    <a href="/assets/images/tryhackme/intro-x86-64/7.png"><img src="/assets/images/tryhackme/intro-x86-64/7.png"></a>

- Start the program.

    <a href="/assets/images/tryhackme/intro-x86-64/8.png"><img src="/assets/images/tryhackme/intro-x86-64/8.png"></a>

- View the `var_ch`, `var_8h`, and `var_4h` values.
    - `var_ch` and `var_8h`:

        <a href="/assets/images/tryhackme/intro-x86-64/9.png"><img src="/assets/images/tryhackme/intro-x86-64/9.png"></a>

        `var_ch` is 0x00 and `var_8h` is 0x60.

    - `var_4h`:

        <a href="/assets/images/tryhackme/intro-x86-64/10.png"><img src="/assets/images/tryhackme/intro-x86-64/10.png"></a>

        `var_4h` is 0x01.

- (Optional) Manual way.

    ```java
    //Initialize
    var_ch = 0
    var_8h = 0x63 (99)
    var_4h = 0x3e8 (1000)

    var_ch -> eax
    compare var_8h (99) > eax (0) //TRUE
    var_8h -> eax

    compare var_4h (1000) > eax (99) //TRUE
    0x64 & var_8h (0x63) //var_8h = 0x60 (96)

    //jump
    var_4h (1000) - 0x3e7 (999) //var_4h = 1

    //END

    //Final values on decimal (before popq and ret):
    // var_ch = 0
    // var_8h = 96
    // var_4h = 1
    ```

    It's the **&** operator that change the value of `var_8h`.

## Loops
Usually two types of loops are used: for loops and while loops. The general format of a while loops is:

```java
while(condition){
  //Do-stuff-here
  //Change value used in condition
}
```

The general format of a for loop is:

```java
for(initialise value: condition; change value used in condition){
  //do-stuff-here
}
```

Follow the instructions:
- Let’s start looking up loops by entering the loops folder, running r2 with the loops 1 file. After this, analyse everything, list the functions and disassemble the main function. 

    <a href="/assets/images/tryhackme/intro-x86-64/12.png"><img src="/assets/images/tryhackme/intro-x86-64/12.png"></a>

    <a href="/assets/images/tryhackme/intro-x86-64/13.png"><img src="/assets/images/tryhackme/intro-x86-64/13.png"></a>

- Let start of by setting a break point at the jmp instruction using the command:

    ```bash
    [0x7f99758a8090]> db 0x5585d3e14613
    ```

    Doing this allows use to skip the first few lines of instructions, which as we saw using if statements, it just passing in values to local arguments (note that the constant showed by `$0xa` represents that value of 10 in hex). 
    
- Once execution reaches the breakpoint at the `jmp` instruction, run `ds` to move to the next instruction. Since this is an unconditional jump, it will move to the `cmpl` instruction.

    <a href="/assets/images/tryhackme/intro-x86-64/14.png"><img src="/assets/images/tryhackme/intro-x86-64/14.png"></a>

    Here the `cmpl` instruction is trying to compare what’s in the local argument `var_ch` with the value 8.

- To see what’s in `var_ch`, check the start of the disassembled function and check the memory.

    <a href="/assets/images/tryhackme/intro-x86-64/15.png"><img src="/assets/images/tryhackme/intro-x86-64/15.png"></a>

    And shows that it contains 4 (0x04).

- The next instruction is a `jle` which is going to check is the value is `var_ch` is less than or equal to 8. Since 4 is less than 8, it will jump to the `addl` instruction. 

    <a href="/assets/images/tryhackme/intro-x86-64/16.png"><img src="/assets/images/tryhackme/intro-x86-64/16.png"></a>

    The `addl` instruction will add 2 to the value of `var`-ch and continue to go to the `cmpl` instruction. Since 2 was added to `var_ch`, `var_ch` will now contain 6 which is still less than 8, and it will jump back to the `addl` instruction. This can be seeing by continuing execution using the `ds` statement. We know this is a loop because the `addl` instruction is being executed more than once, and this is in combination with comparing the value of `var_ch` to 8. So we can infer the structure of the loop to be:

    ```java
    while(var_ch < 8){
        var_ch = var_ch + 2
    }
    ```

    A quicker way to examine the loop would be to add a break point to `cmpl` instruction and running dc. Since this is a loop, the program will always break at the `cmpl` instruction(because this instruction checks the condition before executing what is inside the loop). You can check the `loop1.c `file to see the structure of the loop! 

`loop1.c` file:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void){
  int a = 4;
  int b = 9;
  int c = 10;
  while(a < 9){
    a = a + 2;
  }
return 0;
}
```

#### Answer for loop2 binary
- Open the binary with radare2, analyze the program and disassemble the main function.

    <a href="/assets/images/tryhackme/intro-x86-64/17.png"><img src="/assets/images/tryhackme/intro-x86-64/17.png"></a>

- Getting the `var_8h` and `var_ch` value on the second iteration of the loop.

    <a href="/assets/images/tryhackme/intro-x86-64/18.png"><img src="/assets/images/tryhackme/intro-x86-64/18.png"></a>

    <a href="/assets/images/tryhackme/intro-x86-64/19.png"><img src="/assets/images/tryhackme/intro-x86-64/19.png"></a>

    <a href="/assets/images/tryhackme/intro-x86-64/20.png"><img src="/assets/images/tryhackme/intro-x86-64/20.png"></a>

    The value for `var_8h` is 5 and the value for `var_ch` is 0.

- Getting the `var_8h` and `var_ch` value at the end of the program.

    <a href="/assets/images/tryhackme/intro-x86-64/21.png"><img src="/assets/images/tryhackme/intro-x86-64/21.png"></a>

    <a href="/assets/images/tryhackme/intro-x86-64/22.png"><img src="/assets/images/tryhackme/intro-x86-64/22.png"></a>

    The value for `var_8h` is 2 and the value for `var_ch` is 0.

## crackme1
Let's focus on the `strcmp` instruction. It compares `rsi` and `rdi`.

<a href="/assets/images/tryhackme/intro-x86-64/23.png"><img src="/assets/images/tryhackme/intro-x86-64/23.png"></a>

Insert breakpoint before the first `if`.

<a href="/assets/images/tryhackme/intro-x86-64/24.png"><img src="/assets/images/tryhackme/intro-x86-64/24.png"></a>

Print the `rsi` and `rdi` value to find the real password. Here we can see the password is `127.0.0.1`. 

<a href="/assets/images/tryhackme/intro-x86-64/25.png"><img src="/assets/images/tryhackme/intro-x86-64/25.png"></a>

## crackme2
Let's focus on the `fopen` instruction.

<a href="/assets/images/tryhackme/intro-x86-64/26.png"><img src="/assets/images/tryhackme/intro-x86-64/26.png"></a>

It will open `secret.txt` and read it. So the password must be inside that file. Let's `cat` the password.

```bash
[0x7f4c8934b090]> cat /home/tryhackme/install-files/secret.txt
vs3curepwd
```

If we enter the password to the binary, it will said we got the wrong password.

```bash
tryhackme@ip-10-10-137-87:~/crackme$ ./crackme2 
Please enter password
vs3curepwd
Wrong Password
```

Seems like the password is reversed, let's try to enter it again.

```bash
tryhackme@ip-10-10-137-87:~/crackme$ rev /home/tryhackme/install-files/secret.txt | ./crackme2 
Please enter password
Correct Password
```
